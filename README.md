# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 from a ride-sharing company named Pyber. The results showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. This analysis will help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
## Results
### Bubble Chart 
The following bubble chart was created to show all the rideshare data from January to May 2019 by type of city. The size of the circles directly correlates to the number of drivers per city. At first glance, we can notice that urban cities have the most number of rides with a low average of fare price. Rural cities, on the other hand, have a high average of fare price, with a low number of rides, and low number of drivers available.

### Statistics
Calculating statistics allow us to take a closer look to what's going on with this data. 

- Box-and-whisker plot for ride count data tells us the measures of central tendency per type of city.
  We can see that the mean ride count for urban trips is 24.62, for suburban trips is 17.36, and for rural trips is 6.94.

- Box-and-whisker plot for average fare data tells us the measures of central tendency per type of city.
We can see that the mean fare price for urban trips is $24.53, for suburban trips is $30.97, and for rural trips is $34.62.

- Box-and-whisker plot for driver count data tells us the measures of central tendency per type of city. 
We can see that the mean driver count for urban trips is 36.68, for suburban trips is 13.71, and for rural trips is 4.30.

### Pie charts
The following pie chart showcases the percentage of rides per type of city. Urban cities have the highest percentage of total rides.

This second pie chart showcases the percentage of total drivers for each city type. Urban cities have the highest percentage of total drivers.

### Multi-line graph
This graph shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Each week is a peak or dip in the line graph.

## Summary
Thanks to this analysis we were able to observe the disparities between each type of city. Urban cities have the highest driver count, thus they have a high number of rides, which then means to a low fare price. On the other hand, rural cities have the highest average fare price because of the lack of drivers, meaning in a low ride count. 
What we recommend to the CEO to address these disparities is to focus on having more drivers in rural cities, in order to lower the fare price. Pyber can make campaigns campaigns to get more drivers to work in the ridesharing service by making it easy for them to get the car they will work with (leasing), in case they don't own a car, good commissions and good job/health insurance. This will increase the ride count and lower fare prices. Although there's not so much of a difference in suburban cities, this method for getting more drivers in the ridesharing service helps the little diparity there is in this type of city.
